BISmark Privacy Statement
=========================

Summary
-------

BISmark collects measurements of your ISP's network and the performance of your
Internet service based on traffic and requests generated by the BISmark
software (active measurements). **BISmark does not collect information from
your network traffic.** The BISmark team collects information about your
location and your Internet service, as well as your contact information, as
part of the enrollment process. Information about your Internet service,
location, and BISmark performance measurements will be used to present an
online report of your network performance, and to conduct research related to
home network and broadband Internet performance. Your contact information will
be retained for the duration of your participation in the study.

Full Statement
--------------

This statement describes the information collected as part of your
participation in BISmark, as well as how this information is used, disclosed,
and retained. This statement does not attempt to characterize the risks of
collecting or storing the information, or the disclosure of this information as
described below. You must assess and accept the risks of participating in
BISmark before you agree to participate in the BISmark study.

### Information we collect, and how we use it

We collect three types of information, for the following purposes:

- **Participant Information** is collected as part of the enrollment process. This
  information will be used to maintain contact with participants for the
  duration of the BISmark study.
- **Service Information** is also collected as part of the enrollment process. This
  information will be used for research, analysis, and evaluation of broadband
  Internet service performance.
- **Active Measurement Information** is collected by the BISmark home gateway
  device provided to participants for the duration of their participation in
  the BISmark study. This information will be used for research, analysis, and
  evaluation of broadband Internet service performance. Active Measurement
  Information is collected only from active measurements generated by the
  BISmark measurement device. Network traffic generated by the participant is
  not measured or observed.


Specific examples of information collected in each of these categories is given
below:

**Participant Information**

- name
- email address
- telephone number

**Service Information**

- broadband Internet service provider
- broadband Internet service termination location (e.g. street address,
  town/city, state/province, country)
- broadband Internet service specifications (e.g. access technology, promised
  upload and download rates, data transfer caps, etc.)

**Active Measurement Information**

- throughput (speed) from the gateway to measurement servers
- latency (ping time) from the gateway to Internet locations
- DNS resolution via ISP DNS server
- ISP network topology & network management behavior
- gateway WAN interface IP address, likely your ISP-provided public IP address

### Personally-identifiable information

We consider the following information to be personally-identifiable information
(PII), and we will not disclose it except as indicated under "Information

- gateway WAN interface IP address
- gateway MAC addresses

Other information collected as part your participation in BISmark (e.g. ISP or
network topology) could potentially be used to identify you in certain
circumstances. You must assess and accept the risks of participating in BISmark
before you agree to participate in the BISmark study.

  PII, will be accessible on networkdashboard.org to anyone who knows the LAN
  MAC address of your BISmark home gateway.
